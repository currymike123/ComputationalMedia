    "A <b>function</b> is a set of code within a program that performs a specific task.  They are also reusable and can be used over and over again.  Functions are a powerful programming tool that make programs easier to read and change.  You may see them referred to as \"Procedures\", \"Methods\", or \"Subroutines\" but we will stick with calling them functions.\n",
