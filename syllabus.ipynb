    "This course will serve as an introduction for programming for the digital arts in a visual context.  Students will learn the fundamentals of programming (variables, conditionals, loops and iteration) via the Processing programming language.  Further exploration will apply new skills towards image processing, interactivity, graphics, and sound. "
