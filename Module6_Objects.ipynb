The data and functions have been seperated;  data has been passed to the functions and returned, or stored globally and read.  But a link between them has not been established.  What if we could link data (stored in variables) with a specific set of functions to manipulate the data?   This combination of data and functions is refered to as an <bold>Object.</bold>  \n",
